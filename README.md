This repository contains the source code of Franco Scarpaâ€™s website, [francoscarpa.com](https://francoscarpa.com). I built it from scratch, using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator to help me in the process. I love the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) approach to Web development, and I adopted it when building my website, which is static, super-fast, and with attention to Web accessibility.
